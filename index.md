## About me

I am a third year PhD student in the Computational and Applied Mathematics Department at Rice University. My research interests lie in image segmentation, deep learning, and biomedical informatics. My research is funded by the Ruth L. Kirschstein NIH National Research Service Award Fellowship and is advised by [Dr. Beatrice Riviere](http://compm.rice.edu/people-2/beatrice-riviere/) and [Dr. David Fuentes](https://faculty.mdanderson.org/profiles/david_fuentes.html).
